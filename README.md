# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my Python practice repository! This repo is a collection of Python scripts, mini-projects, and algorithm implementations that I’ve written while learning and exploring the Python programming language.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository includes:

- 🔁 Basic Python programs and syntax practice  
- 🧠 Data structures and algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, etc.)  
- 🎯 Problem-solving exercises and logic building  
- 🛠️ Utility scripts for automation and experimentation  
- 📁 Organized files for easy navigation and understanding  

## 📌 Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Practice writing clean, readable code  
- Explore standard libraries and modules  
- Build up a solid base for larger Python projects  

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the scripts:

```bash
python filename.py
